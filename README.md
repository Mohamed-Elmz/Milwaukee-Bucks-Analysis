# Milwaukee-Bucks-Analysis
An exploratory analysis of the Milwaukee Buck's team performance and game outcomes.

Investigating The Milwaukee Bucks could allow their coaching staff to incorporate insight in the locker room. Such insights can be crucial since their star player has sustained an injury and is not playing. As such, they will need a team effort to advance in the 2023 playoffs.  

I implemented web scraping across multiple web pages to collect my data. This unconventional data collection enabled me to perform many preprocessing tasks, such as data cleaning and wrangling. In addition, I leveraged the ggplot2 and Plotly libraries to create interactive visualizations essential to identifying team performance indicators most significant to winning. 

# Additional Information About the Data

Data sources:
I collected the data for this project from two sources, primary and secondary sources. The primary data, "game data", can be found on the Basketball Reference webpage, a trusted NBA statistics website. The secondary data, "rank data", can be found on the TeamRankings webpage, a website that provides projections, schedules, and rankings across professional and college-level sports.

Data Collection:
The Data is collected and maintained by Data Trader, the Official Statistics Partner of the National Basketball Association. For the past three years, They have been aggregating the data with the purpose of logging the performance of the Milwaukee Bucks throughout each quarter of the season.

What does a case represent:
In the game data, each case represents a game played by the Milwaukee Bucks, and there are a total of 82 games. In the rankings data, each case is a team and its respective rank. There are a total of 30 teams
  
What do the variables mean:
Each variable in the game data is abbreviated and confusing for those who are unfamiliar with them. However, a detailed description of the statistics is available on the NBA Website. https://www.nba.com/stats/help/glossary
