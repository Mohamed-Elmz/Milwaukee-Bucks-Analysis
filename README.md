# Milwaukee-Bucks-Analysis
An exploratory analysis of the Milwaukee Buck's team performance and game outcomes.

Investigating The Milwaukee Bucks could allow their coaching staff to incorporate insight in the locker room. Such insights can be crucial since their star player has sustained an injury and is not playing. As such, they will need a team effort to advance in the 2023 playoffs.  

I implemented web scraping across multiple web pages to collect my data. This unconventional data collection enabled me to perform many preprocessing tasks, such as data cleaning and wrangling. In addition, I leveraged the ggplot2 and Plotly libraries to create interactive visualizations essential to identifying team performance indicators most significant to winning.
