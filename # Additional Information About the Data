Data sources:
I collected the data for this project from two sources, primary and secondary sources. The primary data, "game data", can be found on the Basketball Reference webpage, a trusted NBA statistics website. The secondary data, "rank data", can be found on the TeamRankings webpage, a website that provides projections, schedules, and rankings across professional and college-level sports.

Data Collection:
The Data is collected and maintained by Data Trader, the Official Statistics Partner of the National Basketball Association. For the past three years, They have been aggregating the data with the purpose of logging the performance of the Milwaukee Bucks throughout each quarter of the season.

What does a case represent:
In the game data, each case represents a game played by the Milwaukee Bucks, and there are a total of 82 games. In the rankings data, each case is a team and its respective rank. There are a total of 30 teams
  
What do the variables mean:
Each variable in the game data is abbreviated and confusing for those who are unfamiliar with them. However, a detailed description of the statistics is available on the NBA Website.
